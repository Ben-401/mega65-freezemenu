Freeze menu and associated integrated utilities for the MEGA65.

This program should be installed in the root directory of the MEGA65's SD card
for the MEGA65 to function correctly, as much of the interaction with a MEGA65
is via the freeze menu, e.g., to mount disk images, swap loaded program etc.

This program was started by forking the MEGA65 FDISK/FORMAT utility, since it
has a bunch of the routines we need already in it.
